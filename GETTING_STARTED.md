The caf compiler wrapper
--------------------------

The preferred method for compiling a CAF program is by invoking the `caf` bash script
that the OpenCoarrays CMake scripts install in the `bin` subdirectory of the installation
path. This is an experimental script with limited but useful capabilities that will
grow over time.  Please submit bug reports and feature requests via our [Issues] page.

The `caf` script liberates the source code and workflow from explicit dependence on the
underlying compiler and communication library in the following ways:

1. With an OpenCoarrays-aware (OCA) CAF compiler, the `caf` script passes the unmodified
   source code to the underlying compiler with the necessary arguments for building a
   CAF program, embedding the paths to OpenCoarrays libraries (e.g., `libcaf_mpi.a`) installed
   in the `lib` subdirectory of the OpenCoarrays installation path.  The `caf` script also
   embeds the path to the relevant module file in the `mod` subdirectory of the installation
   path (e.g., `opencoarrays.mod`).  This supports use association with module entities via
   `use opencoarrays`.
2. With a non-CAF compiler (including gfortran 4.9), `caf` supports a subset of CAF by
   replacing CAF statements with calls to procedures in the [opencoarrays module] before
   passing the source code to the compiler.

When using GCC 4.9, we recommend using the `use` statement's `only` clause to
avoid inadvertent procedure name clashes between OpenCoarrays procedures and their
GCC counterparts.  For example, use `use opencoarrays, only : co_reduce`.

With a non-OCA and OCA CAF compilers, the extensions that `caf` imports include the collective
subroutines proposed for Fortran 2015 in the draft Technical Specification [TS 18508]
_Additional Parallel Features in Fortran_.

The latter use case provides an opportunity to mix a compiler's CAF support with that of OpenCoarrays.
For example, a non-OCA CAF compiler, such as the Cray or Intel compilers, might support all of a
program's coarray square-bracket syntax, while OpenCoarrays supports the same program's calls to
collective subroutine such as `co_sum` and `co_reduce`.

A sample basic workflow
-----------------------

The following program listing, compilation, and execution workflow exemplify
the use of an OCA compiler (e.g., gfortran 5.1.0 or later) in a Linux bash shell
with the `bin` directory of the chosen installation path in the user's PATH
environment variable:

```fortran
$ cat tally.f90
      program main
        use iso_c_binding, only : c_int
        use iso_fortran_env, only : error_unit
        implicit none
        integer(c_int) :: tally
        tally = this_image() ! this image's contribution
        call co_sum(tally)
        verify: block
          integer(c_int) :: image
          if (tally/=sum([(image,image=1,num_images())])) then
             write(error_unit,'(a,i5)') "Incorrect tally on image ",this_image()
             error stop
          end if
        end block verify
        ! Wait for all images to pass the test
        sync all
        if (this_image()==1) print *,"Test passed"
      end program
$ caf tally.f90 -o tally
$ cafrun -np 4 ./tally
        Test passed
```

where "4" is the number of images to be launched at program start-up.

An advanced workflow
--------------------

To extend the capabilities of a non-OCA CAF compiler (e.g., the Intel or Cray compilers),
access the types and procedures of the [opencoarrays module] by use association.  We
recommend using a `use` statement with an `only` clause to reduce the likelihood of a
name clash with the compiler's native CAf support.  For example, insert the following
at line 2 of `tally.f90` above:

```fortran
use opencoarrays, only : co_sum
```

To extend the capabilities of a non-CAF compiler (e.g., GCC 4.9), use an unqualified
`use` statement with no `only` clause.  The latter practice reduces the likelihood of
name clashes with the compiler's or programs existing capabilities.

If the `caf` compiler wrapper cannot process the source code in question, invoke
the underlying communication library directly:

```bash
mpifort -fcoarray=lib -L/opt/opencoarrays/ tally.f90 \ -lcaf_mpi -o htally -I<OpenCoarrays-install-path>/mod
```

and also run the program with the lower-level communication library:

```bash
mpiexec -np <number-of-images> ./tally
```
