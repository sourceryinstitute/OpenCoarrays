OpenCoarrays Runtime Libraries
==============================

One original goal of the OpenCoarrays project was to provide a transparent application binary interface (ABI) supported by interchangeable parallel runtime libraries based on a range of communication libraries.  The following header files in the [application-binary-interface](./application-binary-interface) subdirectory define that ABI:

* libcaf.h
* libcaf-gfortran-descriptor.h
* libcaf-version-def.h

where the above files are in dependency order: each file depends on the file(s) listed below it.  The [runtime-libraries](./runtime-libraries) subdirectory contains runtimes based on the following communication libraries:

* Message Passing Interface (MPI)
* OpenSHMEM
* GASNet

We currently maintain, build, and test only the MPI runtime.  The GASNet and OpenSHMEM runtime library source code serve only to provide detailed, open-source documentation of the research described by [Fanfarillo et al. (2014)] and [Rouson et al. (2017)].  For a Fortran 2018 parallel runtime library based on the more recent GASNet-EX exascale networking middleware described by [Bonachea and Hargrove (2018)], please see the [Caffeine] repository.

One exception regarding the transparent nature of the ABI is the [opencoarrays module], which provides a public function that returns the underlying MPI communicator. This capability can be useful for using coarray Fortran to drive an ensemble of simulations using pre-existing MPI as described in [Rouson, McCreight, and Fanfarillo (2017)].
